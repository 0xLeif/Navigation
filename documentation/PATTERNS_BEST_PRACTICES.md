# Patterns and Best Practices

Enhance your application's navigation by following these best practices.

## 1. Use Type-Safe Navigation

Ensure that the data you pass conforms to `Hashable`.

### Example

```swift
struct MyData: Hashable {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
}
```

## 2. Keep Navigation Logic Separate

Encapsulate navigation logic within view models or dedicated navigation handlers.

## 3. Handle Navigation State Carefully

Be mindful of the navigation stack's state to prevent unexpected behavior.

## 4. Consistent Use of `Navigator`

Use the `Navigator` consistently throughout your app to maintain a predictable navigation flow.

## 5. Avoid Deep Navigation Stacks

Keep your navigation stack shallow to improve performance and user experience.

## 6. Testing Navigation

Write unit tests for your navigation logic to ensure reliability.
